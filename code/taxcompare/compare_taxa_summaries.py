    Taxa summaries are compared by computing the correlation coefficient

    taxa. The two taxa summaries are sorted and filled such that taxa that are
    missing in one summary but are present in the other are represented with
    zero abundance.

    written to a file) and a correlation vector (also in a format ready to be

    the associated correlation coefficient.

        comparison_mode - the type of comparison to perform on the two taxa
